# Quantitative-analysis
Daily work in PE fund but will be adjusted a little bit for privacy policy

nav_seperate.py: Using Python Pandas to calculate the daily price change for different portfolios and then summarizing to get the total portfolio NAV change
during some time spans. This is used for backtesting and this is the first time I use multiprocessing to increase the speed since there are more than 240 portfolios csv docs
in a year. For privacy policy, I would not provide source csv docs since they are very sensitive. 


2/2 Update for nav_seperate.py: Revised the some algorithms in order to improve the performace under intel python.
